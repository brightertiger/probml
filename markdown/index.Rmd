# About

- Hi I am brightertiger! I am a data scientist looking to expand my knowledge about ML.

- This is a collection of _notes_ based on my reading of the book _Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction_ by _Kevin P Murphy_. The draft copy of this book can be downloaded from [here](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html).
